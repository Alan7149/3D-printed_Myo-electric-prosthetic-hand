> This project illustrates how 3D Printing enables frugal innovation and thereby addresses the needs of people who aren’t served or who are under-served due to the lack of economic power or due to the small size of addressable market. The entire project was approached as a full-time endeavour.The arm is electronically actuated and controlled by servo motors. The bionic arm presented has the potential to be used by an amputee or person born without a limb. This type of technology does exist although it is expensive and generally not available to people in developing countries.The root of the system is an innovative mechanical design for a 3D printed prosthetic hand. Modern day electronic actuators and circuitry animate the device and allow for control schemes.
